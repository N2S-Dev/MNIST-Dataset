# MNIST-Dataset
This is a collection of all 70,000 28-by-28 pixel grayscale handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset downloaded by a python script I ran. The copyright for the MNIST dataset is held by Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes, who derived the dataset from NIST datasets. They made it avaialable under the CC BY-SA 3.0 (Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0) license. All the images in this GitHub repo fall under this license and, when used or modified, have to be attributed to Yann LeCunn and Corinna Cortes. The reason this repo is not under the CC0 license is because I am referencing the original creators of the MNIST dataset. However, if you choose to use this to download digits, it isn't necessary to cite me, just cite the original creators.
